Fotogrub
====

Fotogrub is an as-yet unfinished social networking site for food connoisseurs which is written in the Play! Framework. Users have a profile page similar to Twitter. Their posts can be random things they think of sending out, or they can choose to associate a specific restaurant with their post and give it a rating. Users can add or remove followers view all posts on the site, or search for restaurants by restaurant name or by city.
